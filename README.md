## Introduction

This project illustrates the process of feature transformation, an essential step in preparing data for machine learning models. Feature transformation involves modifying or creating features to enhance the performance and interpretability of models. This README provides an overview of the feature transformation techniques employed in this project.

## Feature Transformation Techniques

### 1. **Scaling**

- **Description:** Scaling ensures that numerical features are on a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process.
  
- **Implementation:**
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    ```

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**

- **Description:** Addressing missing values is crucial as they can hinder model performance. Various strategies include imputation or removal of missing values.

- **Implementation:**
    ```python
    # Impute missing values using mean
    X.fillna(X.mean(), inplace=True)
    ```

### 3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**

- **Description:** Categorical variables need to be converted into a numerical format for machine learning models. Common techniques include one-hot encoding or label encoding.

- **Implementation:**
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

    encoder = OneHotEncoder()
    X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X[['Category']])
    ```

### 4. **Log Transformation**

- **Description:** Log transformation is useful for handling skewed data, making it more suitable for models that assume normality.

- **Implementation:**
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    X['skewed_feature'] = np.log1p(X['skewed_feature'])
    ```

### 5. **Feature Engineering**

- **Description:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones based on domain knowledge can enhance model performance.

- **Implementation:**
    ```python
    # Feature engineering code here
    ```
